This repository demonstrates a less-obvious instance of a ZeroDivisionError. The Python function `function_with_uncommon_error` contains an error that occurs when the first argument is 0. The error is less obvious than a direct division by zero, because the condition is implied by the function's logic. The solution shows how to handle this error using a `try-except` block.
